I've moved all my projects and my home page to <a href="http://code.borsboom.io/">GitHub</a>.  I left out everything not code-related, but the Internet Archive has [my old blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20130828131258/http://www.epiphyte.ca/weblog.html), [my old photo galleries](http://web.archive.org/web/20130828131258/http://www.epiphyte.ca/photos.html), and [the rest](http://web.archive.org/web/20130828131258/http://www.epiphyte.ca/).
